Version: 0.1.0
Author: Mary Heejung Waverly Mohammad
Maintainer: maryac330@berkeley.edu
Description: This package provides a function, select(), which allows the user to input their dataset, specify a linear model, and then uses the genetic algorithm to optimize the model selection process. The select() function depends on four auxiliary functions: initialize(), selection(), crossover(), and mutation().
