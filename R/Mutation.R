# From the Givens and Hoeting book:
#Mutation rates are typically very low, in the neighborhood of 1%. Theoretical
#work and empirical studies have supported a rate of 1/C [464],
# and another investigation suggested that the rate should be nearly proportional
# to 1/(PâˆšC) [571]. Nevertheless, a fixed rate independent of P and C is
# a common choice.
mutation <-function( P_i , mutationProb , C ){

  # Identifying which sites should be mutated
  mut <- which( runif( C , 0 , 1 ) < mutationProb )

  P_i[ mut ] <- ifelse( P_i[ mut ] == 1 , 0 , 1 )

  return( P_i )
